Special Note: POST Otp Screen- Otp verfication api: http://devapiv4.dealsdray.com/api/v2/user/otp/verification
              POST Register Screen- Email with referral api: http://devapiv4.dealsdray.com/api/v2/user/email/referral
              Both these API's are not working so that these API's are giving a proper Json response on Postman, that's why I routed the page directly from OTP Screen-to-Register Page to Homescreen without 
              verifying the OTP, and without Registering the user but I have designed the pages. 
              Left API's are working fine and I have integrated all of thge API's correctly and designed the application with a beautiful UI design.
